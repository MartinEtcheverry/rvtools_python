# rvtools
Application to be executed on Linux and collect all information from vCenter

The idea is to be a similar application as RVTools [1] the main difference is, the application from website was designed to be executed only on MS platform, this version will be written in python 3.x so will be possible execute on Linux environment.

About the final result, the idea is generate one similar output *CSV files*.

The point here is not about COPY but just improve the Python skill and use the project [1] as reference once this one is a fantastic product !!!

Thank you and feel free to request Features / Enhancements.
